# Todo-list
Ember frontend coding exercise for interviews

# Goals

1) Build a todo list that is capable of adding, removing, and editing different tasks.

2) Add the ability to add, remove, edit sub tasks

It is up the developer working on this to choose what UI will get built. It doesn't need to be fancy or styled in any  particular way. Functionality is the most important thing

There is no backend to save data so everything will be stored in local state
